# Babel Day #01

Second Babel Day. A day in which we speak many programming languages at once. Continuing the linguistic theme. 
This time your goal will be to create a dictionary app. Below you'll find a list of features to implement. 
Each feature is worth some amount of gems (:gem:). Your goal is obvious - collect as many gems as possible. 
Here's a list of features with user stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to find translations in the dictionary, so that I can express myself in a foreign language.
- As a user, I want to be able to add some words to my dictionary, so that I can find them later.
- As a user, I want the search to be case insensitive so that I don't have to take care of the casing while providing a search phrase. E.g. HoMe matches home
- As a user, I want to see the results of a search which match only a part of the provided search phrase so that I don't have to type in the exact phrase. E.g. pro matches appropriate
- As a user, I want the app to fix my typos in search phrases and return similar results so that I don't have to know the exact spelling of words. E.g. aple matches apple; lenght matches length
- As a user, I want to load this English Esperanto dictionary - http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16967/16967-0.txt so that I can learn Esperanto. Tip: analyze file structure first.
- As a user, I want to save my dictionary to a file so that I can load it again later.
- As a user, I want to retrieve search results in less than one second so that I don't get bored.
